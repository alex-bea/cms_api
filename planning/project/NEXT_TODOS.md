## 💡 **Key Questions to Answer**

1. **Data Source Strategy**: Should we scrape CMS websites, use APIs, or both?
2. **Update Frequency**: How often should we check for new data? (Daily, weekly, monthly?)
3. **Data Storage**: Should we store raw files, processed data, or both?
4. **Error Handling**: How should we handle CMS website changes or data format changes?
5. **Compliance**: Are there any legal or compliance requirements for data acquisition?
6. **Cost**: What are the costs of different data acquisition approaches?

## 🚀 **Success Metrics**

- **Data Freshness**: New RVU data available within 24 hours of CMS release
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for data acquisition and API
- **Performance**: API response times under 100ms for cached queries
- **Data Quality**: 99.5% data accuracy and completeness
- **Developer Experience**: API adoption and developer satisfaction scores

**Note**: This TODO list is prioritized based on the current system state and the need for dynamic data acquisition. The web scraping approach is recommended as the primary method since CMS typically publishes data on their website, but API integration should be explored as a more reliable alternative.
