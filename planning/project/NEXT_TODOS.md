## üåê **Priority 5: Integration & Ecosystem**

### 5.1 External Integrations
- [ ] **Third-Party Integrations**
  - [ ] Integrate with healthcare data platforms
  - [ ] Add FHIR API support
  - [ ] Implement webhook notifications
  - [ ] Add SDK for common programming languages

- [ ] **Data Export & Import**
  - [ ] Implement bulk data export
  - [ ] Add data import from external sources
  - [ ] Implement data transformation tools
  - [ ] Add data migration utilities

### 5.2 Developer Experience
- [ ] **Documentation & Tools**
  - [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
  - [ ] Add interactive API explorer
  - [ ] Implement code generation tools
  - [ ] Add developer onboarding guides

- [ ] **Testing & Development Tools**
  - [ ] Create local development environment
  - [ ] Add data seeding tools
  - [ ] Implement testing utilities
  - [ ] Add debugging and profiling tools

## üéØ **Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**

1. **Research CMS Data Sources**
   - [ ] Investigate CMS website structure and data availability
   - [ ] Research CMS APIs and data access methods
   - [ ] Identify best approach for automated data acquisition

2. **Prototype Web Scraper**
   - [ ] Build basic scraper for one RVU dataset
   - [ ] Test download and parsing capabilities
   - [ ] Implement basic error handling and retry logic

3. **Enhance Current System**
   - [ ] Add database dependency testing
   - [ ] Implement real data ingestion testing
   - [ ] Add performance monitoring and alerting

4. **Documentation & Planning**
   - [ ] Create technical architecture document
   - [ ] Plan data acquisition strategy
   - [ ] Design monitoring and alerting system

## üí° **Key Questions to Answer**

1. **Data Source Strategy**: Should we scrape CMS websites, use APIs, or both?
2. **Update Frequency**: How often should we check for new data? (Daily, weekly, monthly?)
3. **Data Storage**: Should we store raw files, processed data, or both?
4. **Error Handling**: How should we handle CMS website changes or data format changes?
5. **Compliance**: Are there any legal or compliance requirements for data acquisition?
6. **Cost**: What are the costs of different data acquisition approaches?

## üöÄ **Success Metrics**

- **Data Freshness**: New RVU data available within 24 hours of CMS release
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for data acquisition and API
- **Performance**: API response times under 100ms for cached queries
- **Data Quality**: 99.5% data accuracy and completeness
- **Developer Experience**: API adoption and developer satisfaction scores

**Note**: This TODO list is prioritized based on the current system state and the need for dynamic data acquisition. The web scraping approach is recommended as the primary method since CMS typically publishes data on their website, but API integration should be explored as a more reliable alternative.
