# Observability & Monitoring PRD (v1.0)

## 0. Overview
This document defines the **Observability & Monitoring Standard** for the CMS Pricing API. It unifies data pipeline observability, API service monitoring, and testing observability under a single five-pillar framework. This PRD consolidates observability content from the Data Ingestion Standard (DIS) and QA Testing Standard (QTS) to eliminate redundancy and provide consistent monitoring across all domains.

**Status:** Adopted v1.0  
**Owners:** Platform Engineering (SRE + Data Engineering)  
**Consumers:** Product, Engineering, Data, Ops, QA  
**Change control:** ADR + Architecture Board review

**Cross-References:**
- **DOC-master-catalog_prd_v1.0.md:** Master system catalog and dependency map
- **STD-data-architecture_prd_v1.0:** Data pipeline lifecycle, quality gates, and ingestion observability
- **STD-qa-testing_prd_v1.0:** Testing philosophy, coverage requirements, and test observability
- **STD-api-security-and-auth_prd_v1.0:** Security observability, audit logging, and incident response procedures  

## 1. Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**
- Provide unified observability across data pipelines, API services, and testing systems
- Establish consistent five-pillar monitoring framework (Freshness, Volume, Schema, Quality, Lineage)
- Define clear SLAs and SLOs for data health, service health, and testing health
- Enable proactive incident detection and response with standardized alerting
- Integrate with existing infrastructure (structlog, Prometheus, custom alert system)

**Non-Goals**
- Real-time streaming observability (covered by separate streaming standard)
- Business intelligence dashboards (covered by separate analytics standard)
- User experience monitoring (covered by separate UX standard)

## 2. Five-Pillar Observability Framework

Modern observability focuses on **system health** across all domains. We mandate metrics and alerts across five pillars, with domain-specific implementations.
